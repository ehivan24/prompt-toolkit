Create a clear episode structure that includes:

	•	3–5 main content segments, each with titles and talking points
	•	Suggested questions or prompts for audience engagement
	•	A conclusion that reinforces takeaways and encourages next steps (e.g., subscribing, visiting a site)
Ensure the episode flows naturally and supports strong listener retention.
